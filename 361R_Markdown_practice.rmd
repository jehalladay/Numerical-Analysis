## Text Options

R Markdown allows us to type in paragraphs of text. WE can also include mathematical notation using $\LaTeX$. Here is an *inline* math formula: $\int_a^b f(x) dx$. Here is a formula in **display** mode

$$ \int_a^b f(x) dx $$

Here is an aligned multi-line display

\begin{aligned}
\int_0^1 2x dx &= x^2 \left|_0^1 \right. \\
&= 1^2 - 0^2 \\
&= 1 \\
\end{aligned}







This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
